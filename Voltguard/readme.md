## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voltguard.git
cd voltguard
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure hardware connection:
   - Connect your mmWave sensor to your computer via USB
   - Note the port name (e.g., COM3 on Windows, /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux)
   - Update the port configuration in `server.js`

4. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

5. Open the web interface:
